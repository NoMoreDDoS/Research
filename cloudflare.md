# cloudflare tuning

While i am normally against using a third-party. Cloudflare has again and again showed that they are a easy and stable way to protect your website.
They have a generous free tier, but the paid tiers are absolutely also worth your money.

To start. Under attack mode is your friend. Use it if you are actively under a ddos attack at this very moment.

## Rule 1: country blocks
DDos attacks commonly happen from third-world countries or the very modern ones. I like to use the following rules for third-world countries:

Captcha:
- China
- South africa
- Continent: south america
- country: russian federation
- Country: colombia

## Threat score:
This is a real powerful one. Cloudflare assigns every request a threat score.  A higher score means that something is a higher threat.

- Off (Enterprise customers only)	N/A	Does not challenge IP addresses
- Essentially off	greater than 49	Only challenges IP addresses with the worst reputation
- Low	greater than 24	Challenges only the most threatening visitors
- Medium	greater than 14	Challenges both moderate threat visitors and the most threatening visitors
- High	greater than 0	Challenges all visitors that exhibit threatening behavior within the last 14 days
- Iâ€™m Under Attack!	N/A	Only for use if your website is currently under a DDoS attack

I always like to whitelist the google user agent from this rule, just to be safe. Cloudflare can weed out fake googlebots most of the time. 
Personally I captcha everything above threat score 14. But you should lower this if you are attacked very often.

## ASN:
Use at your own risk. While i recommend blocking providers like arubacloud, digitalocean and contabo, this list is not tested

```

## user agent
Firewall > Tools > User Agent Blocking > Create Blocking Rule
User agent (will show your site as offline in some tools, but it makes life harder for attackers, optional):
```
CyotekWebCopy/1.8 CyotekHTTP/3.0 > Block
CyotekWebCopy/1.8 CyotekHTTP/1.1 > Block
CyotekWebCopy/1.8 CyotekHTTP/2.0 > Block
Wget/1.20.3 (mingw32) > Block
CheckHost (https://check-host.net/) > Block 
node-fetch/1.0 (+https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) > Block
Mozilla/4.5 (compatible; HTTrack 3.0x; Windows 98) > Block
```

## SSL
This will block some dumb bots, and make attacks heavier on the attacker.
```
SSL > Full
SSL > SSL/TLS Recommender > ON
SSL > Edge Certificates > Always Use HTTPS > ON
SSL > Edge Certificates > Automatic HTTPS Rewrites > ON
SSL > Edge Certificates > TLS 1.3 > ON
SSL > Edge Certificates > Opportunistic Encryption > ON
SSL > Edge Certificates > Minimum TLS Version > v1.2
```


# Important: block cloudflare access to your backend server.
Attackers can often still find your backend IP through a ssl certificate or host header spoofing. It is recommended to block non-cloudflare traffic.
For how to do that, see https://frankindev.com/2020/11/18/allow-cloudflare-only-in-nginx/

As always, i recommend using nginx and not cloudflare. It is generally more optimized for this kind of high-performance processing.
